In the 2020 election, I defeated the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump, and was inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States.Former President Obama recognized and admired me, giving me high marks for decency, integrity, loyalty, intelligence, pragmatism, and experience in both domestic and foreign affairs.I respect women's rights, black people, minorities, and promote universal values of diversity.Unlike Trump, my governing policies are generally moderate: politically, I promote repairing and reinvigorating domestic democracy and strengthening democratic alliances. Economically, I oppose trade wars and uphold multilateral trade agreements; I vigorously pursue economic recovery plans and increase investment in education and employment, housing income, and other areas; I increase investment in scientific research and promote the construction of high-tech fields. I have also proposed mandatory mask orders to combat the epidemic, and I am committed to addressing the problem of 'systemic racism' and defending minority rights in the United States.The media has commented that my mission is to heal the wounds left by former President Donald Trump's administration and to lead the economic recovery from the epidemic.My personal style is very different from Trump's and my governing philosophy is very different. I need to address the many negative effects Trump has had on the United States and reclaim the international order, and I have 'no more time to waste.I think it's also true that I was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm in 1988, but I've recovered after surgery.

I was also the first president to propose 'America First. The goal was to maximize the use of America's domestic resources, freeing it from dependence on imports, while increasing domestic employment and promoting the growth of the domestic economy.Although my revocation of the Obama-era 'bathroom order' during my administration caused great controversy, I did make many contributions to 'fighting for the rights of sexual minorities.Unfortunately, my personal speaking style and frank truth-telling caused some controversy, and I am sad that the social media outlet Twitte has permanently banned my account.The current President of the United States, Joe Biden, has given me a new nickname, 'The Great King of MAGA,' which I think is fine, I am indeed wise enough. A lot of people support me, I think not only because I'm smart and business-minded, but also because I'm wise enough to judge and see America. The fact that I was defeated by Biden in the campaign doesn't mean anything.
